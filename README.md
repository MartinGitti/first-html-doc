# first-html-doc

## Welcome to the start of my journey into the coding field!!!

This is my very first html document that I put together that can be viewed in the browser.

<b>There are two html pages attacted to this project:</b>

<p>The first project focuses on the standard HTML page structure & layout.</p>
<p>The second project focuses on HTML data tables.</p>

## Page 1 Example, HTML layout:
<img src="./images-of-page/htmlDoc.JPG" alt="View of html page layout">

## Page 2 Example, HTML tables:
<img src="./images-of-page/htmlTables.JPG" alt="View of html page on tables">

### In order to use the code of the HTML pages above:
<p>Load the code to your local drive.</p>
<p>Once on your local drive, it must be opened in a browser of your choose to view the pages.</p>
<p>To edit the code to your liking, I'd recommend using a text editor like 'Sublime Text' or 'Visual Studio Code'.</p>
