# first-html-doc

## Welcome to the start of my journey into the coding field!!!

This is my very first html document that I put together that can be viewed in the browser.

<b>There are two html pages attacted to this project:</b>

<p>The first project focuses on the standard HTML page structure & layout.</p>
<p>The second project focuses on HTML data tables.</p>

## Page 1 Example, HTML layout:
<img src="./images-of-page/htmlDoc.JPG" alt="View of html page layout">

## Page 2 Example, HTML tables:
<img src="./images-of-page/htmlTables.JPG" alt="View of html page on tables">

Happy Coding :sunglasses:
